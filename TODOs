There a bug in version 0.1.0.0 of the open telemetry api package that causes the
wrong call stack entry to be used. Might want to have `autoInstrument` take an
explicit CallStack to be impervious to such version depedent issues.

The function attribute should be the function being instrumented, not `inSpan`
and the code location should be location of the function definition, not the
callsite of `inSpan`.
