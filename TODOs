Implement constraint rules

There a bug in version 0.1.0.0 of the open telemetry api package that causes the
wrong call stack entry to be used. Might want to have `autoInstrument` take an
explicit CallStack to be impervious to such version depedent issues.

Should the user be able to specify constructors or constraints that take more
than 1 argument? How would that work?
- config includes an `arguments` field which is an array of strings.
- can specify wildcard arguments with _
- when matching a constructor, check that each application matches the
  expected argument. fail to match if there are too many or too few arguments
- constraints can be handled the same
What about constraints that take some portion of the constructor application?
Should be allowed and doesn't seem like it'd require any special handling.
